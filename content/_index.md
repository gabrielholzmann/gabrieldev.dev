# Welcome to my Website! 👋🐱

Hello! My name is Gabriel, I’m a 24-year-old programmer from **Londrina, PR – Brazil** with a liking for **C**, **C++**, **linux**, and **low-level programming**. 

I created this blog as a space to share my personal projects, experiments, and the occasional rambling about code, technology, and anything else that captures my mind.

You’ll mostly find:

- Build logs and write-ups of the things I’m tinkering with
- Thoughts on programming puzzles, algorithms, and problem solving
- Notes on tools, languages, and techniques I find interesting
- Random discoveries along the way

Thanks for stopping by — stick around and explore!
