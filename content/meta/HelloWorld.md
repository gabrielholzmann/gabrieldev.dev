# Hello, Welcome to my first blog post!

First a quick little introduction: My name is Gabriel, I'm a 24-year-old software engineer
located in Londrina - PR - Brazil. 

I created this website because I believe everybody should have their own little corner of the internet to share 
their own thoughts, ideas and projects without having to rely on big tech to do so.

With my own custom website and domain I have 100% control on the technologies, design and hosting of the website.

If you are curious about what I'm using to make this website:
- <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a> is a static website generator
- <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank">Bulma</a> is a CSS library(because I suck at CSS)

My first project on this website will be a walkthrough of every <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank"> Advent of Code 2024</a>
problem, even though it's not Christmas it's still fun! (maybe i will cover other years too)

If you have any suggestions or just want to contact me check out the [contact](/contact) page, for now I only have email and discord,
but I might create a social media account like BlueSky who knows

Thanks for reading!
